"""
The app: notes per user, and an assistant that keeps them.

Each key of a session object (``alice``, ``bob``, …) has its own SQLite
database, ``ctx.db``, stored in Restate together with the object's state. The
assistant is an agent, a session object too: each user's conversation is kept
in its own database, and it takes notes by calling ``notes`` through Restate.

Run it with a Restate server on this machine (see README.md)::

    uv run app                                                  # serves `app` on PORT, 9080 by default
    curl localhost:8080/notes/alice/add --json '"Buy milk"'
    curl localhost:8080/notes/alice/list                        # ["Buy milk"]
    curl localhost:8080/assistant/alice/chat -d 'Remind me to call the bank.'
    curl localhost:8080/notes/alice/list                        # ["Buy milk", "Call the bank"]

Or chat with the assistant from a terminal, and see its tool calls as they happen::

    uv run python -m restate.agents chat assistant/alice

The assistant needs OPENAI_API_KEY. On Modal, the same ``app`` connects to
Restate Cloud instead (modal/on_modal.py): ``python -m restate connect app.__main__:app``.
