"""
The software factory: four agents, and the two webhooks that start them.

    Linear ──webhook──▶ triage ──call──────▶ planner
                               ──subagent──▶ coder ◀──webhook── GitHub
                               ──subagent──▶ reviewer

Each agent is keyed by its task: triage and the planner by the issue
(``triage/ENG-1``), a coder and its reviewer by the issue's part
(``coder/ENG-1.parser``). How it all works: README.md.
