"""
Restate as tools

A support agent whose tools are Restate itself: it looks orders up with a
plain service, waits for a manager's approval (a signal), and refunds with a
workflow. Every step is durable: a crash, or a manager who takes a day,
changes nothing::

    uv run python -m restate serve examples.support:app
    curl localhost:8080/support/alice/chat/send -d 'Order 103 arrived broken, can I get my $30 back?'

The agent waits for approval. See what it waits for (the refund, with the
wait's id), and approve it::

    curl localhost:8080/support/alice/pending
    curl localhost:8080/support/alice/signal --json '{"name": "approval", "value": "approved"}'
    curl localhost:8080/support/alice/messages   # the refund, and the answer

``/send`` sends the message without waiting for the answer, which waits for
the approval. ``{"id": "<the id>", "value": ...}`` answers one wait by its id.

Or all of it from a terminal: ``uv run python -m restate.agents chat support/alice``,
then ``/pending`` and ``/signal approval approved`` while the agent waits.
