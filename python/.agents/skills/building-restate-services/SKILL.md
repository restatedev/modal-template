# Restate in this project

Restate is a durable execution runtime: services run behind a Restate Server (ingress on
port 8080, admin and UI on 9070), which retries them through crashes. This project uses
**two execution models side by side**, and their rules contradict each other. **Before
writing or changing a handler, decide which model it uses, and follow only that model's
rules.**

If another Restate skill is loaded too (such as the restatedev plugin's own
`building-restate-services`), its mandatory rules, `ctx.run_typed` around every side effect,
`restate.gather` instead of `asyncio.gather`, and replay tests, are for journaled handlers
only. For session objects and agents, this skill's rules take precedence: never suggest
`ctx.run`, `ctx.sleep`, `ctx.get`/`ctx.set` or awakeables there.

## Step 1: which model is this handler?

|                                      | **Session object**                                                                                                                                       | **Journaled handler**                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Defined with                         | `sessions.SessionObject(...)` of `restate.sessions`; `openai.agent(...)`, `langgraph.agent(...)`, `pydantic_ai.agent(...)`, `adk.agent(...)`, `AgentObject(...)` of `restate.agents` | `restate.Service(...)`, `restate.VirtualObject(...)`, `restate.Workflow(...)`                 |
| Handlers                             | `@obj.handler` (one at a time per key, writes) and `@obj.view` (beside them, reads)                                                                     | `@svc.handler()`, `@wf.main()`                                                                |
| Context                              | `sessions.SessionContext`, `sessions.ViewContext`                                                                                                       | `restate.Context`, `restate.ObjectContext`, `restate.WorkflowContext`, ...                     |
| After a failure                      | Runs again **from its first line**, against its database. No journal replay                                                                              | **Replays its journal**: completed steps return their recorded results                         |
| State                                | `ctx.db`: a SQL database per key                                                                                                                         | `ctx.get` / `ctx.set` key/value state                                                          |
| Side effects                         | Directly; make them safe to run twice (stable ids such as `ctx.request.id`, idempotency keys)                                                            | Inside `ctx.run_typed(...)`                                                                    |
| Concurrency                          | `asyncio.gather` / `asyncio.wait` are fine                                                                                                               | `restate.gather`, `restate.select`, `restate.as_completed`; never `asyncio` combinators        |

| Timers, awakeables, durable promises | Not available: a delayed `ctx.send(..., delay=...)` for later work, a `wait_for_signal` tool for an agent's wait, a journaled workflow for the rest       | `ctx.sleep`, `ctx.awakeable`, `ctx.promise`                                                   |
| Calls                                | `await ctx.call(handler, arg, key=..., idempotency_key=...)`, `ctx.send(...)`, `tx.send(...)`; `generic_call` / `generic_send` by name                   | `ctx.service_call`, `ctx.object_call`, `ctx.workflow_call` and their `_send` variants          |
| Testing rule                         | Show that a handler run twice does its work once                                                                                                         | A replaying test (the project has no test setup yet: ask before adding one)                    |

**For new code, choose the type first.** In short:

- **An AI agent or LLM conversation**: `restate.agents` (`openai.agent(...)` or another
  framework's `agent(...)`). Add handlers of your own beside `chat` with `@agent.handler`, and
  ask a model once from one with `pydantic_ai.prompt(ctx, text)`.
- **Data per key that you insert, update and query** (a list, a history, a ledger, a cart):
  a **session object**.
- **A process with a start and an end that waits** (for a person, a callback, a timer), once
  per id: a **workflow**.
- **A few values per key, with timers or awakeables inside the handlers**: a **virtual
  object**. **No state per key**: a **service**.
- All of them live in one deployment and call each other. A file can hold several: decide
  per handler, never per file.

Never carry a rule across: don't wrap `ctx.db` in `ctx.run_typed` (a session object has no
`ctx.run`), and don't use `asyncio.gather` in a journaled handler.

## Step 2: the project

- `app/__main__.py` is the application, and the only folder deployed on Modal: its services
  go in `app = restate.app([...])`, the ASGI app, and it ends with
  `restate.serve(app)` under `if __name__ == "__main__"`. `uv run app` serves it on `PORT`
  (9080 by default); `python -m restate connect app.__main__:app --name notes-python-v1`
  connects the same `app` to Restate Cloud, which is what Modal runs. Don't add a `connect`
  call or a switch to the file.
- `restate.app([...])` serves everything: services, virtual objects, workflows, session
  objects and agents. An agent brings along what it needs (the `signals` object its tools
  wait on), served once however many agents there are. Anything with a
  `__restate_services__()` method (`restate.Servable`) can be listed, such as a group of
  services.
- `tutorial/`: the tutorial, one idea per lesson, for reading and copying into
  `app/__main__.py`; nothing serves it, and it has no `__init__.py`. Each lesson ends with its
  `services`. Lessons 01–08 are session objects; 09–15 agents on the OpenAI Agents SDK
  (`openai.prompt`, `openai.agent`, `@tool`, tools that write, `call`, `wait_for_signal`,
  `subagent`), and 16 an `Agent` of the SDK of your own, with handoffs. Read the closest
  lesson before writing similar code; list a new one in `tutorial/README.md`.
- `examples/`: complete examples, one module each, ending with `app = restate.app([...])`:
  `chat` (OpenAI Agents SDK), `langgraph_agent`, `models` (LangChain chat models of your
  own), `memory` (an agent with a table of its own) and `support` (a service, a workflow and
  a signal as tools). `uv run python -m restate serve examples.<name>:app`
  serves one on this machine. Their extra dependencies are in the `examples` group of
  `pyproject.toml`, which Modal doesn't install.
- From `python/`: check with `uv run ruff check && uv run ruff format --check && uv run pyright` (strict),
  and format with `uv run ruff format`.
- To run it locally, connect it to Restate Cloud, or deploy it on Modal: the
  **deploying-on-modal** skill.
- The examples call a local server, `curl localhost:8080/…`. On Restate Cloud, the same paths
  work at your environment's ingress (`https://<environment id>.env.<region>:8080`) with
  `-H "Authorization: Bearer <ingress API key>"`: see deploying-on-modal, "Calling handlers".

## Session objects (`restate.sessions`)

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

import restate
from restate import sessions

wallet = sessions.SessionObject(
    "wallet",
    migrations=[
        "CREATE TABLE entries (id TEXT UNIQUE, amount INTEGER NOT NULL)",
        # Append steps later; never edit or remove one that has run.
    ],
)


class Transfer(BaseModel):
    to: str
    amount: int


@wallet.handler
async def deposit(ctx: sessions.SessionContext, amount: int) -> None:
    # ctx.request.id is the same on every attempt: a retry inserts nothing new.
    await ctx.db.execute("INSERT OR IGNORE INTO entries (id, amount) VALUES (?, ?)", [ctx.request.id, amount])


@wallet.handler
async def transfer(ctx: sessions.SessionContext, money: Transfer) -> None:
    async with ctx.db.transaction() as tx:  # commits when the body ends, rolls back if it raises
        if await tx.get("SELECT 1 FROM entries WHERE id = ?", [ctx.request.id]) is None:
            await tx.execute("INSERT INTO entries (id, amount) VALUES (?, ?)", [ctx.request.id, -money.amount])
            row = await tx.get("SELECT coalesce(sum(amount), 0) AS balance FROM entries")
            if row is not None and int(row["balance"] or 0) < 0:
                raise restate.TerminalError("Not enough money")  # not retried; rolls back
            tx.send(deposit, money.amount, key=money.to)  # delivered only if the transaction commits


@wallet.view
async def balance(ctx: sessions.ViewContext) -> int:
    row = await ctx.db.get("SELECT coalesce(sum(amount), 0) AS b FROM entries")
    return int(row["b"] or 0) if row else 0
```

- `ctx.db` (`Database`): `execute`, `query` (rows as dicts), `get` (first row or `None`),
  `values`, `query_columns`, and `transaction()`. Each statement outside a transaction
  commits on its own. Inside `async with ctx.db.transaction() as tx`, use `tx`, never
  `ctx.db`. A helper that only reads takes a `sessions.DatabaseReader`, so it works with a
  handler's, a view's and a transaction's database.
- The database is SQLite-compatible (Turso's engine), stored in the object's Restate state.
  SQL expressions need `AS` to name their column.
- Handlers run one at a time per key; a view runs at once, reads what was committed when it
  started, can't write or send, and may call.
- `ctx.key`, `ctx.request.id` (stable across attempts), `ctx.cancel(invocation_id)`.
- `ctx.call(handler, arg, key=, idempotency_key=)` is typed by the handler function and is
  made right away, awaited or not. A call that changes something needs an idempotency key
  that is the same on every attempt (`f"{ctx.request.id}:claim"`). `ctx.send(..., delay=)`
  is one-way; `tx.send` goes out with its transaction's commit.
- Two session objects that call each other and wait can deadlock (each runs one request at a
  time per key): send instead.
- Handler inputs and outputs are JSON; Pydantic models work as both.

## Agents (`restate.agents`)

```python
from restate.agents import call, openai, subagent, tool, wait_for_signal


@tool
async def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """The current weather in a city."""  # the docstring is the tool's description
    return f"Sunny and 21°C in {city}"


assistant = openai.agent(
    "assistant",
    system="Answer briefly.",
    tools=[
        get_weather,
        call(status, description="The status of an order."),  # a Restate handler as a tool
        wait_for_signal("approval", description="Wait for a manager's approval.", input=Refund),
        subagent(researcher),  # another agent as a tool
    ],
)
```

- Every framework's `agent(name, ..., model=, system=, tools=, **options)` returns an
  `AgentObject`: a session object whose key is a conversation, stored in its database.
  `openai` (OpenAI Agents SDK), `langgraph`, `pydantic_ai` and `adk` each need their extra
  (`restate-sdk[openai]`, ...) and their model provider's package.
- The model is `"<provider>/<model-id>"`, else `$RESTATE_AGENT_MODEL`. `system`, `model` and
  `tools` may be functions of the context, for values per user.
- Tools: `@tool` for your own functions (typed parameters, docstring); `call`, `send`
  (with `delay=`), `workflow`, `subagent` and `wait_for_signal`, built on Restate, work with
  every framework. A tool may run again after a crash mid-call: make it safe to run twice
  (a tool function's `idempotency_key` parameter).
- Built-in handlers and views of every agent: `chat` (takes plain text: `curl -d 'Hi'`),
  `messages`, `status`, `pending`, `signal`, `stop`, `clear`, `sync`, `watch`,
  `notifications`. These names are reserved.
- Resolve a wait: `curl localhost:8080/assistant/alice/signal --json '{"name": "approval", "value": "approved"}'`.
- Follow an agent from a terminal: `uv run python -m restate.agents chat assistant/alice`
  (needs the `client` extra).
- An agent loop of your own, with no framework: `restate.agents.internal`
  (`answer_once`, `Conversation`, `run_tool`) on an `AgentObject`.

## Restate CLI

Operate a running Restate Server with the CLI (`npx @restatedev/restate@1.8.1 …`, or
`restate` if installed): register deployments, inspect and manage invocations, read state,
query the server with SQL. It describes itself, so ask it instead of guessing:

- `restate --help`, `restate <command> --help`, and `restate search <what you want to do>`.
- `restate sql --help` lists the introspection tables; `restate sql describe <table>`.
- Always pass `--json`. A command that changes something (register, cancel, kill, purge,
  state edits) prints its plan with `"applied": false` and exits with code 3: show the plan
  to the user, and only then run it again with `--yes`.
- `restate whoami --json` says which server it talks to (by default `localhost:9070`).

## Before finishing

- Session objects and agents:
  - [ ] Every handler is safe to run twice: stable ids (`ctx.request.id`, a caller's id),
        `INSERT OR IGNORE`, idempotency keys on calls that change something
  - [ ] Writes that belong together are in one `transaction()`, and its sends are `tx.send`
  - [ ] Migrations only appended to, never edited
  - [ ] No `ctx.run`, `ctx.sleep`, `ctx.get`/`ctx.set` or awakeables
- Journaled handlers:
  - [ ] Side effects, external I/O and database calls inside `ctx.run_typed`; no Restate
        context operation inside a `run` callback
  - [ ] No `time.time()`, `random`, `asyncio.sleep` or `uuid4()`: `ctx.time()`,
        `ctx.random()`, `ctx.sleep()`, `ctx.uuid()`
  - [ ] `restate.gather` / `restate.select`, not `asyncio` combinators
  - [ ] `TerminalError` for failures that must not be retried
  - [ ] No deadlock cycles between virtual objects calling each other
- Always: lint passes, the service is in `restate.app([...])` in `app/__main__.py` (or an
  example's `app`), and it was called
  through Restate (curl, the playground, or the UI).
