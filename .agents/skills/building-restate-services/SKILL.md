  Design, build, run and test Restate services in TypeScript in this repository: session
  objects with a SQL database per key (@restatedev/sessions), durable AI agents on them
  (@restatedev/agents: pi, OpenCode, LangGraph, Claude, DeepSeek), and journaled Restate
  services, virtual objects and workflows (@restatedev/restate-sdk). Use when the user
  mentions Restate, session objects, sessionObject, ctx.db, durable agents, virtual objects,

# Restate in this repository

Restate is a durable execution runtime: services run behind a Restate Server (ingress on
port 8080, admin and UI on 9070), which retries them through crashes. This repository uses
**two execution models side by side**, and their rules contradict each other. **Before
writing or changing a handler, decide which model it uses, and follow only that model's
rules.**

If another Restate skill is loaded too (such as the restatedev plugin's own
`building-restate-services`), its mandatory rules, `ctx.run` around every side effect,
`RestatePromise` instead of `Promise.all`, and always-replay tests, are for journaled
handlers only. For session objects and agents, this skill's rules take precedence: never
suggest `ctx.run`, `ctx.sleep`, `ctx.get`/`ctx.set` or awakeables there.

## Step 1: which model is this handler?

**For new code, choose the type first**, with
[choosing-service-types.md](references/choosing-service-types.md): service, virtual object,
workflow, session object or agent, and how they combine. In short:

- **An AI agent or LLM conversation**: `@restatedev/agents` (`pi.agent`, or `sessionObject`
  with `pi.chat` beside your own handlers). Not a hand-written agent loop.
- **Data per key that you insert, update and query** (a list, a history, a ledger, a cart):
  a **session object**.
- **A process with a start and an end that waits** (for a person, a callback, a timer), once
  per id: a **workflow**.
- **A few values per key, with timers or awakeables inside the handlers**: a **virtual
  object**. **No state per key**: a **service**.
- All of them live in one deployment and call each other. A file can hold several: decide
  per handler, never per file.

Never carry a rule across: don't wrap `ctx.db` in `ctx.run` (a session object has no
`ctx.run`), and don't use native `Promise.all` in a journaled handler.

## Step 2: the repository

- `src/app.ts` is the application: its services go in `services`, which
  `restate.connect({ services, name: 'notes-v1' })` connects to Restate Cloud. For a Restate
  server on this machine, the commented `restate.serve({ services, port: 9080 })` line
  replaces it.
- `src/tutorial/`: the tutorial, one idea per lesson, off by default (see the comment in
  `src/app.ts`). Lessons 01–08 are session objects, 09–16 agents. Read the closest lesson
  before writing similar code. If `src/examples/` exists, it has agents, one per file.
- Import the SDK from `@restatedev/sessions` (it re-exports `@restatedev/restate-sdk` at the
  version it pins). Don't add another `@restatedev/restate-sdk` version.
- Node 24 runs the TypeScript directly: `node src/app.ts`. Check with `pnpm lint` (tsc,
  oxlint, oxfmt) and format with `pnpm format`.
- To run it locally, connect it to Restate Cloud, or deploy it on Modal: the
  **deploying-on-modal** skill.

The journaled references come from [restatedev/skills](https://github.com/restatedev/skills)
(MIT, see `references/LICENSE-restatedev-skills.md`), with a scope note at their top. Where
they say "the bundled MCP server", use https://docs.restate.dev if no MCP server is set up.

## Restate CLI

Operate a running Restate Server with the CLI (`npx @restatedev/restate@1.8.1 …`, or
`restate` if installed): register deployments, inspect and manage invocations, read state,
query the server with SQL. It describes itself, so ask it instead of guessing:

- `restate --help`, `restate <command> --help`, and `restate search <what you want to do>`.
- `restate sql --help` lists the introspection tables; `restate sql describe <table>`.
- Always pass `--json`. A command that changes something (register, cancel, kill, purge,
  state edits) prints its plan with `"applied": false` and exits with code 3: show the plan
  to the user, and only then run it again with `--yes`.
- `restate whoami --json` says which server it talks to (by default `localhost:9070`).

## Before finishing

Run the checklist of each model you touched:

- Session objects and agents: the checklists at the end of
  [session-objects.md](references/session-objects.md) and
  [restate-agents.md](references/restate-agents.md).
- Journaled handlers:
  - [ ] Side effects, external I/O and database calls inside `ctx.run`; no Restate context
        operation inside a `ctx.run` callback
  - [ ] No native random, time, sleep or UUIDs: `ctx.rand`, `ctx.date`, `ctx.sleep`
  - [ ] `RestatePromise` combinators, not native `Promise` ones
  - [ ] `TerminalError` for failures that must not be retried
  - [ ] No deadlock cycles between virtual objects calling each other
  - [ ] Logic changes covered by an always-replay test (see `ts/api-and-pitfalls.md`)
- Always: `pnpm lint` passes, the service is in `services` in `src/app.ts`, and it was
  called through Restate (curl, the playground, or the UI).
